Paint 0.0.2 - When the Pizza Roll is too Hot - 9/4/20

New Features:
	* New "Edit" menu (With a Draw & Erase option)
	* Added the ability to remove pixels with an "Erase" CheckMenuItem (under the Edit menu).
	* Added the ability to draw a line with an "Line" CheckMenuItem (under Edit/Draw menu).
	* Added a "Edit Options" window, that allows you to select the brush size, as well as the color for drawing
	* Added a "New" option under the File menu, bringing up a dialog box to create a new image
	* The Canvas is also wrapped in a ScrollPane, to allow a complete view via scrolling.
	* The Canvas' dimensions are now updated on the fly to fit the opened image.
	* Work is being done to have Paint be a modal image editor.
	* Keyboard Shortcuts are now a thing!!
	* Switched to using a VBox for the root pane.
	* Now using a Canvas instead of an ImageView for presenting images.

Known Issues:
	* Need to find an elegant way of drawing lines and other shapes on the canvas (maybe through a popup window?)
	* Currently Save and Save As can only save an image as a PNG, not as any other format (The program can still open files of any format, it just can't save as them)
	* Java Doc!!! This needs to be done

Expected Features:
	* Autosave functionality
	* Drawing Geometric shapes (squares, circles, n-sided polygon)?
	* Blur tool?
	* Tutorial? (new editing style, that being a modal editor)
	* Dark Mode (theming)

Paint 0.0.1 - Calm before the Storm - 8/28/20

New Features:
	* Can open/save/saveas/view images
	* "Save" overwrites the original image with the correct image format
	* "Save As" can save a specified output image in the correct format^1
	* Can clear out the currently selected image
	* Can exit via the file menu
	* Has a menubar (with a "File" and "Help" menu)
	* Has a primitive "About" window
	* Extened the MenuBar class (Now CustomMenuBar), to handle all of the MenuBar code.
	* Basic filetype detection (through getting the file's extension)

Known Issues:
	* To make sure that the menubar visible, I have reduced the image size to be a max of 500 x 500 (via ImageView.setFitHeight & setFitWidth), the ratio is still preserved though.

Expected Features:
	* Expand the help menu. Add in a license window
	* A filetype detection system on opened images.
	* A file handler?

Links:
	* None yet... (but there will be soon)

Footnotes:
	1 - let's say that you open a png image, and in the "Save As" window you want to save the image as a jpeg, instead of defaulting to png
