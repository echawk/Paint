First Minor Release!

Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea6JCPUfito

New Features:
	* Removed Edit Menu, as it was clunky and unintuitive.
		- Replaced with an Edit ToolBar
	* Added View Menu
		- Has both zoom in and zoom out (plus a reset)
			- Resizes the Canvas, and thus Image (Feature, not a bug)
	* Added Mode Menu
		- Now has keyboard shortcuts! (ESC to go to default menu, and CTRL+E for edit menu)
	* Can Now Draw Straight Lines!
	* Can Now Draw: Squares, Rectangles, Circles, & Ellipses
		- Only fill supported, no frames.
	* Added a primitive Stack-Based Undo system
	* Added a "Smart"-er save
		- Now if you create a new file, and you "Save", it will open the "Save As" prompt
	* Fixed the Bug with trying to save images as a format that isn't a PNG
		- TLDR: You can save as whatever format now!
	* Stared work on Writing JavaDoc Comments throughout the code
		- Also updated some older comments
	* Now have a Color Grabber!!
		- Available in the EditToolBar combobox

Known Bugs:
	* Missing JavaDoc
		- The code isn't clear in some areas (lack of doc)
	* When undo-ing an action, it may take dozens of presses of the undo button, because there are too
		many images in the stack.
	* "Reset" function under the view menu doesn't quite work yet
	* The zoom in/out features don't work exactly how I inted for them to work

Expected Features:
	* Theming Support


Paint 0.0.2 - When the Pizza Roll is too Hot - 9/4/20

New Features:
	* New "Edit" menu (With a Draw & Erase option)
	* Added the ability to remove pixels with an "Erase" CheckMenuItem (under the Edit menu).
	* Added the ability to draw a line with an "Line" CheckMenuItem (under Edit/Draw menu).
	* Added a "Edit Options" window, that allows you to select the brush size, as well as the color for drawing
	* Added a "New" option under the File menu, bringing up a dialog box to create a new image
	* The Canvas is also wrapped in a ScrollPane, to allow a complete view via scrolling.
	* The Canvas' dimensions are now updated on the fly to fit the opened image.
	* Work is being done to have Paint be a modal image editor.
	* Keyboard Shortcuts are now a thing!!
	* Switched to using a VBox for the root pane.
	* Now using a Canvas instead of an ImageView for presenting images.

Known Issues:
	* Need to find an elegant way of drawing lines and other shapes on the canvas (maybe through a popup window?)
	* Currently Save and Save As can only save an image as a PNG, not as any other format (The program can still open files of any format, it just can't save as them)
	* Java Doc!!! This needs to be done

Expected Features:
	* Autosave functionality
	* Drawing Geometric shapes (squares, circles, n-sided polygon)?
	* Blur tool?
	* Tutorial? (new editing style, that being a modal editor)
	* Dark Mode (theming)

Paint 0.0.1 - Calm before the Storm - 8/28/20

New Features:
	* Can open/save/saveas/view images
	* "Save" overwrites the original image with the correct image format
	* "Save As" can save a specified output image in the correct format^1
	* Can clear out the currently selected image
	* Can exit via the file menu
	* Has a menubar (with a "File" and "Help" menu)
	* Has a primitive "About" window
	* Extened the MenuBar class (Now CustomMenuBar), to handle all of the MenuBar code.
	* Basic filetype detection (through getting the file's extension)

Known Issues:
	* To make sure that the menubar visible, I have reduced the image size to be a max of 500 x 500 (via ImageView.setFitHeight & setFitWidth), the ratio is still preserved though.

Expected Features:
	* Expand the help menu. Add in a license window
	* A filetype detection system on opened images.
	* A file handler?

Links:
	* None yet... (but there will be soon)

Footnotes:
	1 - let's say that you open a png image, and in the "Save As" window you want to save the image as a jpeg, instead of defaulting to png
